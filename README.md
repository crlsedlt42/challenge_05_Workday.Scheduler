# Workday Scheduler

## Description

As a responsible web developer, I want to schedule my workday before starting my day to meet all deadlines. 
This challenge I was given HTML and CSS that needed JavaScript to provide functionality as each hour passes by during a normal workday. 
As the work day passes the website will show what task needs to be started on that hour in red and the website will show green for upcoming tasks/events.

## Installation

Node packages weren't used in this project, so no installation is required. 

## Usage

To use the application, all you need is to input you task, habit, event etc, based on what time you want it to start. The text within the middle columns will be saved and the colored columns as time passed by will be shown.
